#README.md - scripts

## Overview
This repository contains a set of scripts for various uses, organised along broad subject lines by subfolder. The code is not always exactly exemplary.

The dependencies (and possibly languages) may vary for each script. Please refer to individual **README** details for each subfolder and script.

## Subfolders
The current set of subfolders includes:

* `bioinformatics`: scripts that cover applications in bioinformatics, sometimes in support of publications.
* `maths`: scripts that either demonstrate mathematical principles/algorithms or provide practise for me in coding them up.
* `media`: scripts for manipulating and processing media files, e.g. `mp3`, `mp4`, `avi`, etc.
* `misc`: This covers a range of sundry tasks, from file reformatting, to very ad hoc analyses of information and files that will make no sense to anyone else.
