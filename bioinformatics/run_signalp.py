# run_signalp.py [euk|gram+|gram-] <FASTAfile> [-o|--outfilename <output file>]
#
# Takes a FASTA format file containing protein sequences as input, and runs
# a local copy of SIGNALP on the contents, collecting the output
# generated with the -short option
# This script splits the input file into a number of smaller FASTA files
# suitable for distributed processing using, e.g. multiprocessing, with
# a maximum number of sequences per file of 1000 to avoid falling foul
# of SIGNALP's undocumented upper limit.  SIGNALP is run independently on 
# each split file, and the results concatenated into the output file.
# If no output file is specified, then the output file shares a stem with
# the input file.
# The organism type is specified at the command line in the same way as for
# SIGNALP
